# Iron Fish

Iron Fish is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to secure user transactions. Since our mainnet launch on April 20, 2023, our ecosystem has grown under the stewardship of the Iron Fish Foundation.

## Iron Fish Foundation

The Iron Fish Foundation drives secure crypto privacy through strategic partnerships, grants, and events. Our governance and funding are community-focused, ensuring that privacy remains at the forefront.

- **Grants:** We fund projects that enhance user experience, interoperability, and expand Iron Fish use cases.
- **Governance:** Our Board of Directors oversees strategic decisions and compliance, ensuring robust privacy standards.

## Core Principles

1. **Encryption is Fundamental:** We use industry-leading encryption and zk-SNARKs to protect user data.
2. **Collaborative Development:** We build together with our community of developers and privacy advocates.
3. **Common Sense Compliance:** We balance privacy with responsible regulatory practices.
